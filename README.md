#### Introduction
Node.js clustering is a technique used to take advantage of multi-core systems by creating multiple instances of a Node.js process to handle incoming requests. This allows for better utilization of system resources and improved application performance.

In this repository, I aim to explore various aspects of setting up, configuring, and managing a Node.js cluster for personal learning purposes. I'll cover topics such as clustering strategies, load balancing, fault tolerance, and more.

#### Setup
To follow along with my learning journey, you'll need to have Node.js installed on your system. You can download and install Node.js from the official website.

Once you have Node.js installed, clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:


```bash
git clone git@github.com:AjiMk/node-cluster-example.git
```

#### Basic Concepts
- Node.js Cluster Module: Understanding the built-in cluster module in Node.js for creating child processes.



#### Resources
Here are some resources that I've found helpful during my learning journey:
